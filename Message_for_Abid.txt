Abid Message for you


Data is loaded into the database some entity question_tag,quiz_question(bridge  entity) missing

Backend is loading data but somehow frontend is not loading it.
Here I tried to show all questions with options
Backend loaded all but frontend couldn't

remember 

to Load Backend -> node index.js in server terminal
to Load frontend ->npm run dev in client terminal

You may try to solve the problem of frontend try  not to mess with other as much as possible
but do it .You can do it.
